          <h2>Exchange Policy</h2>

          <h3>Damaged Products</h3>
          <p>
              If you receive a damaged product, we offer an exchange service. To initiate the exchange process, 
              please fill out the form provided below. We apologize for any inconvenience caused and will make 
              every effort to resolve the issue promptly. In cases where the product is damaged, we kindly ask 
              you to provide an unboxing video. This step is necessary to confirm that the error was on our part. 
              Please rest assured that we thoroughly inspect all products before shipping them to our valued customers.
          </p>

          <h3>Size Issues</h3>
          <p>
              If you encounter size-related issues with your order, we are happy to facilitate an exchange for the 
              same product in a different size. In the event that the same product is unavailable, you will be given 
              the option to select an alternative dress from our collection. To ensure a proper fit, we kindly ask you 
              to refer to our size chart before placing your order.
          </p>

          <h3>Timely Exchange Requests</h3>
          <p>
              To ensure a smooth exchange process, we request that you submit the exchange form within 48 hours of 
              receiving your order. If the request is not made within this time frame, an exchange will not be provided.
